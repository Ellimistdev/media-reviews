## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/endotnick/media-reviews.git
$ bundle install
```

Migrate and Seed dev DB:

```bash
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```

[Omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) integration is handled through the setting of the following environment variables:

`TWITTER_KEY`, `TWITTER_SECRET`  
`GOOGLE_KEY`, `GOOGLE_SECRET`  
`FACEBOOK_KEY`, `FACEBOOK_SECRET`  

Either set the environment variables on your system, or add to a `.env` file at the root of the project. The [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem is included in development and should automatically pick up your `.env` file.

## Development

After installation, run 

```bash
$ thin start --ssl
```
to launch the dev server.   
The app should be running on `localhost:3000` by default
